# Changelog

All notable changes to **zark** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.5] — 2026-05-01

### Security

- `recover` now aborts when the backup is missing its keystore zvol, instead of silently producing a system that boots into an emergency shell.
- The two unsafe fallbacks (embedding the raw key in the rootfs, switching `rpool` to `keylocation=prompt`) were considered and rejected for silently degrading the security model the user set up.

### Tooling

- Added `tox.ini` (py3.12/3.13/3.14 + lint env), with mypy/pylint/ruff versions declared in `pyproject.toml` under `[dependency-groups].dev` (PEP 735) as a single source of truth.
- Added Ruff's `RUF027` rule to pre-commit to catch stripped `f`-string prefixes — the v1.0.4 root cause.
- Added GitHub Actions CI: tests matrix (py3.12/3.13/3.14, fail-fast off) and a lint job; integration tests (QEMU) deliberately remain local.

### Distribution

- Added Debian/Ubuntu packaging (`debian/`, `3.0 (quilt)`) installing under `/usr/share/zark/` with `/usr/bin/zark` as a symlink — `lib/config.py`'s existing path search handles the layout without code changes.
- Added `make deb` / `make deb-source` / `make deb-ppa` driving `debuild`, with PPA uploads iterating over Ubuntu 24.04 → 26.04; see `debian/README.packaging.md` for the maintainer flow.
- Added a CI `package` job gated on `refs/tags/v*` that builds an unsigned `.deb` and attaches it to the GitHub Release; signed PPA upload stays local.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-04-30

Initial public release of zark under its current name.

zark is a portable Python-based bare-metal ZFS backup and recovery suite
for Ubuntu systems with full-disk encryption, UEFI Secure Boot, and
zero-installation portability (runs from a USB pendrive).

For the design philosophy, command set, and supported environments, see
the project README.
